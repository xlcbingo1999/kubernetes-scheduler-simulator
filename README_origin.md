# üöÄ Kubernetes Scheduler Simulator

The simulator evaluates different scheduling policies in GPU-sharing clusters.
It includes the Fragmentation Gradient Descent (FGD) policy proposed in the ATC paper ([Beware of Fragmentation: Scheduling GPU-Sharing Workloads with Fragmentation Gradient Descent](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc23/presentation/weng)), along with other baseline policies (e.g., Best-fit, Dot-product, GPU Packing, GPU Clustering, Random-fit). 

## üöß Environment Setup

Please ensure that Go is installed.

`go mod vendor` installs the dependencies required for the simulator. 

```bash
$ go mod vendor
```

`make` generates the compiled binary files in the `bin` directory.

```bash
$ make
```

## üî• Quickstart Example

The following example will schedule 6 pods to a cluster with 2 nodes, and the expected output will show the allocation ratio of each resource dimension (CPU, memory, GPU).
The default scheduling policy is fragmentation gradient descent (FGD).

```bash
$ bin/simon apply --extended-resources "gpu" \
                  -f example/test-cluster-config.yaml \
                  -s example/test-scheduler-config.yaml
```

## üîÆ Experiments on Production Traces

Install the required Python dependency environment.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Please refer to [README](data/README.md) under the `data` directory to prepare production traces.
2. Then refer to [README](experiments/README.md) under the `experiments` directory to reproduce the results reported in the paper.

## üôèüèª Acknowledge

Our simulator is developed based on [open-simulator](https://github.com/alibaba/open-simulator) by Alibaba, a simulator used for cluster capacity planning. 
This repository primarily evaluates the performance of different scheduling polices on production traces.
GPU-related plugin has been merged into the main branch of [open-simulator](https://github.com/alibaba/open-simulator).

## ‚è≥ TODO

- [ ] Add a minikube running example to demonstrate how the simulator schedules pods in a **real** Kubernetes cluster.
